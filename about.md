My name is Michael Clark and as you may have noticed I am a budding Software Engineer!  
I got into developement simply because I find programming immensely interesting.  In proggraming there are an endless amount of routes you can take in order to reach a specific outcome and that of itself is intrguing.
My goal is to become an established developer so that I can mentor up and coming developers(like my current self) and help them grow a nd find success in a field that we commonly love.
This portfolio is currently a collection of applications that I worked on during my immeersive course at General Assembly. At the time I was attending class full time as well as working full time so my strees levels swere immense.  
That being said I didn't have as much time for these projects as most people but for the most part I am proud of what I've accomplished.  Heck at least you can see im dedicated.
"It ain't much but it's honest work."

Reasons:
- Honing my skills as a developer.
- Easy access to my collection of apps.
- Just for fun.
